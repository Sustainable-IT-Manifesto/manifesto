# The Green Software Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

**Resource Efficiency over Resource Abundance**
Just as a well-written code is a work of art, so is the efficient use of resources. We understand that in an age where resources are seemingly abundant, it is easy to become complacent. However, we choose to prioritize resource efficiency to reduce the environmental footprint of our software.

** Consider Return on Environment over Return on Investment**
Focus of long term Sustainability Impact and Gains over short term Cost reduction, productivity and profitability. Practicing proper Sustainable IT will lead to better efficiency, better resource utilization, edge over competition and thus better business value.

**Long-term Sustainability over Short-term Gains**
We value the foresight to see beyond the immediate benefits and consider the long-lasting impact of our decisions. Long-term sustainability guides us to create software that not only meets the current needs but does so while ensuring minimal impact on our planet.

**Holistic Impact Awareness over Siloed Focus**
The decisions made in one phase of the software development lifecycle can have ramifications across the entire spectrum. By embracing a holistic perspective, we aim to make choices that account for the full lifecycle of the software and its environmental impact.

**Continuous Environmental Improvement over Static Practices**
The essence of agility is the acceptance of change. We believe that as our understanding of environmental challenges evolves, so too must our practices. This is a journey of continuous learning and improvement, aimed at reducing the ecological impact of our software.

**Collaboration for Sustainability over Individual Excellence**
We recognize that the challenges ahead are greater than any individual or team. It is through collaborative efforts, sharing of knowledge, and open dialogue that we can foster innovations leading to greener software solutions.

While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Applying the Principles:

### Developers and Architects
- Embrace efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Continuously refactor code for performance improvements.
- Consider the energy efficiency of libraries and frameworks.
- Practice green coding principles and architecture

### DevOps and Cloud Professionals
- Automate resource scaling to minimize waste.
- Monitor and optimize energy and resource consumption.
- Choose cloud providers and data centers which implement sustainable practices with renewable energy policies.

### Testers
- Test for application performance and resource consumption.
- Incorporate sustainability metrics into test reports.

### Agile Practitioners
- Foster a mindset where sustainability is integral to agility.
- Include sustainability in sprint goals and definitions of done.

### Product Owners
- Consider sustainability as a critical feature in product backlogs.
- Actively engage with stakeholders on the importance of sustainability.

### Management and Leadership
- Set the vision and goals concerning sustainability.
- Create a culture that understands and values environmental considerations.
- Move from digital transformation to sustainable digital transformation

This manifesto serves as a guiding light to align our endeavors in creating software that is not only functional and robust but is also developed with the consciousness of its impact on our environment. Through our daily choices, continuous improvements, and collaborations, let's contribute towards a sustainable future for all.
